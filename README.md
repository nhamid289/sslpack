# sslpack

A package for semi-supervised learning.

`sslpack` is designed to be intuitive and compatible with PyTorch-style scripting.
It contains implementations of many popular algorithms and datasets, and provides several utilities to streamline testing and development of
new algorithms.

## Usage

`sslpack` is designed for making scripts that look like conventional Pytorch scripts. The key components such as the algorithm, model, dataloader, optimiser are all modular. See the examples available in [Examples](https://github.com/nhamid289/sslpack/tree/main/examples)
